## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- 🐳 Docker: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- 🎮 Kubernetes: [Install Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- 👩‍💻 Kubectl: Command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes clusters [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
  
---

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started quickly with the Kubernetes setup, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kubernetes-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd kubernetes-project
   ```

3. Deploy your application to the Kubernetes cluster:  
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

---

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Configure Kubernetes Cluster 🌐
Set up a Kubernetes cluster using your preferred method (e.g., Minikube, AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS).

### 2. Configure Kubernetes Context 📜
Ensure you are connected to the correct cluster by setting up your context:
   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context <your-cluster-name>
   ```

---

## 📦 Deployment

You can deploy the app to your Kubernetes cluster with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-deployment.yaml
```

This will create the necessary deployments, services, and pods in your cluster. 🚢

---

## 📝 Configuration

If you'd like to customize the configuration of your Kubernetes resources, modify the YAML files located in the `/k8s` directory.

You can adjust:

- **Replicas**: The number of instances of your application running.
- **Resources**: CPU and memory limits for the containers.
- **Environment Variables**: Custom environment variables for your app.

---

## 🧐 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are a few steps to help you:

1. **Check Kubernetes pods**  
   To view the status of your pods, run:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

2. **View logs**  
   To check the logs of a pod, run:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```

3. **Describe resources**  
   For detailed information about a resource, run:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name>
   ```
